## Critical Raid Leader Callouts

- **"Bikers spawning - stack for cleave!"**
- **"Tank swap NOW - Tank Buster incoming"**
- **"Grab bikes and crash - need X more stacks"**
- **"Intermission starting - all cooldowns, CC the adds!"**
- **ðŸ”´ "Oil Slick players move to edges"**

## Positioning Strategy

```
    [Boss]
      |
   [Melee]
      |
  [Ranged]
      |
  [Healers]
```

- Keep boss near wall for Oil Slick management
- Stack tight for Biker cleave
- Spread for Exhaust Fumes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not removing Protective Plating stacks fast enough
2. Tanks not moving after Tank Buster (Oil Slick placement)
3. Missing bike assignments causing wasted crashes
4. Poor intermission CC leading to overwhelming damage
5. Fire players not clearing Oil Slicks efficiently
