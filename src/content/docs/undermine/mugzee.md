# Mug'Zee, Heads of Security - Heroic Raid Leader Guide

## Boss Overview

**Core Mechanic:** Mug (right) vs Zee (left) positioning
**Bloodlust:** Phase 2 start

## Split Mechanics System

### Arena Division

```
[====MUG====]|[====ZEE====]
   (Right)   |   (Left)
```

### Side Determination

- **Active Head:** Based on majority player positioning
- **Energy Generation:** Active head gains energy
- **Swap Requirement:** Before 100 energy (wipe)

- **Permafrost:** Growing ice patches on ground
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Frostshatter:** Exploding ice spears

## Phase 1 Strategy (100-30%)

### Side Swapping System

- **Call:** "SWAP SIDES NOW"
- **Movement:** Entire raid moves together
- **Reset:** Energy returns to 0 on swap

### Tank Assignments

- **2 tanks required:** One per side
- **Positioning:** Keep heads at markers
- **Cooldowns:** Trade for tank busters
- **Phase 2 prep:** Save major CDs

## Phase 2 - Both Heads Active (30-0%)

### Key Changes

- **Both heads:** Active simultaneously
- **No more swaps:** Positioning locked
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC:** 30% haste on both bosses
- **Overlap danger:** Abilities can overlap

### Positioning

```
[MUG]          [ZEE]
  |              |
Tank1         Tank2
  |              |
[===RAID SPREAD===]
```

## Role-Specific Assignments

### Tank Strategy

- **Phase 1:** One tank per side, no swapping
- **Phase 2:** Maintain separation, trade cooldowns
- **Positioning:** Keep 30+ yards apart
- **Communication:** Call out tank buster timings

### Healer Assignments

- **Phase 1:** 2 healers per side
- **Swap timing:** Move early to maintain healing
- **Phase 2:** Raid-wide healing priority
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC:** Extra CDs for Frostshatter

### DPS Priorities

1. **Phase 1:** Focus active head only
2. **Earth Shield:** Immediate purge
3. **Frozen Solid:** Help with dispels
4. **Phase 2:** Equal damage on both

## Critical Raid Leader Callouts

### Phase 1

- **"Mug at 70 energy - prepare to swap"**
- **"MOVE LEFT NOW - Zee active"**
- **"Earth Shield up - PURGE"**

### Phase 2

- **"Phase 2 - both active, stay spread"**
- **"Tank cooldown rotation starting"**
- **"Frostshatter coming - use personals"** (ðŸ”´ heroic)
- **"Overlap incoming - defensive CDs"**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Phase 1 Errors

1. Swapping too late (energy too high)
2. Split raid during swaps
3. Not purging Earth Shield
4. Standing in Permafrost patches

### Phase 2 Errors

1. Tanks too close together
2. Stacking during ability overlaps
3. Uneven damage on heads
4. Missing Frostshatter timing

## Tips for Success
