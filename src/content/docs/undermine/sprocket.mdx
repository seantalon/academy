## Arena Mechanics

### Conveyor Belt System

```

### Mega Magnetize

- **Timer:** 15 seconds to destruction
- **Priority:** Must clear before resuming boss
- **Assignment:** Ranged DPS focus

## Intermission Mechanics (100 Energy)

1. **Knockback:** All players launched to edges
2. **Empowered Inventions:** Abilities cover larger areas
3. **ðŸ”´ HEROIC:** Foot-Blaster Bombs spawn
4. **Duration:** ~20 seconds
5. **Resumption:** Boss vulnerable after inventions

## Tank Strategy

- **Movement:** Lead boss during zone transitions

- **Stacks:** Applied by melee attacks
- **Effect:** Slowing + damage increase
- **Swap point:** 3-4 stacks
- **Duration:** 30 seconds

## Role Assignments

### DPS Priorities

1. **Boss damage** during safe windows
2. **ðŸ”´ Foot-Blaster Bombs** immediately in intermission
3. **Electro-Shock Mines** when spawned
4. **Movement discipline** for zone transitions

### Healer Considerations

- **Raid damage:** Spikes during Rocket Barrage
- **Movement healing:** Maintain output while dodging
- **Cooldowns:** Save for empowered abilities
- **Positioning:** Central safe zones preferred

## Critical Raid Leader Callouts

- **"Zones shifting in 5 - move to 1 and 4!"**
- **"Intermission incoming - spread for knockback"**
- **"BOMBS FIRST - all ranged on bombs!"** (ðŸ”´ heroic)
- **"Beams casting - find safe spots"**
- **"Tank swap at 3 stacks"**

## Movement Strategy

### Pre-Intermission

- Keep raid loosely stacked in safe zones
- Tanks position boss for easy transitions
- Maintain 5-yard minimum spread

### Post-Intermission

- Clear bombs before engaging boss
- Reform in new safe zones
- Resume normal positioning

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Standing in electrified zones during transitions
2. Not prioritizing Foot-Blaster Bombs
3. Getting pulled into bad zones by Magnetize
4. Poor positioning for beam patterns
5. Tank not moving boss during zone shifts

## Tips for Success

- Use raid markers for zone identification
- Assign bomb teams for intermissions
- Practice zone transition callouts
- Keep boss centered when possible
- Save movement abilities for emergencies
