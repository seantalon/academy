# Cauldron of Carnage (Torq & Flarendo) - Heroic Raid Leader Guide

## Boss Overview

**Fight Style:** Twin boss encounter with mandatory positioning  
**Phases:** Single phase with intermissions at 100 energy  
**Bloodlust:** On pull  
**Key Requirement:** Both bosses must die simultaneously

## Positioning Strategy

- **Separation:** Bosses must be 40+ yards apart or become immune
- **Group Split:** Divide raid into two equal groups
- **Side Assignment:** Torq (left) vs Flarendo (right)

## Boss-Specific Mechanics

### Torq the Tempest (Lightning Boss)

- **Static Charge:** Movement fills energy bar - full bar = 6s stun
- **Thunderdrum Salvo:** Missiles at player locations
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Voltaic Images:** Shadow adds that fixate and explode
- **Lightning Bash:** Tankbuster with knockup

### Flarendo the Furious (Fire Boss)

- **Scrapbomb:** Group soak mechanic (4+ players required)
- **Blistering Spite:** Stacking fire DoT within 60 yards
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Molten Phlegm:** AoE damage + healing absorb
- **Blastburn Roarcannon:** Frontal beam on fixated player

## Intermission - Colossal Clash (100 Energy)

- **Trigger:** Both bosses reach 100 energy
- **Effect:** Massive raid damage if not positioned correctly
- **Response:** All players move to center, then swap sides
- **Tank Swap:** Required after each Clash

## Tank Strategy

- **Separate tanks** for each boss (never tank both)
- **Tank swap** after each Colossal Clash (intermission)
- **Torq Tank:** Minimize movement to avoid Static Charge
- **Flarendo Tank:** Position for Scrapbomb soaking

## Healer Assignments

- **Split healing teams** between both sides
- **Cooldown rotation** for Colossal Clash
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC:** Extra healing for Molten Phlegm absorbs
- **Dispels:** Priority on high Static Charge stacks

## DPS Priorities

1. **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Voltaic Images** - CC and kill immediately
2. **Equal boss damage** - must die together
3. **Scrapbomb soaking** - assigned groups
4. **Movement discipline** on Torq side

## Critical Raid Leader Callouts

- **"CLASH INCOMING - MOVE TO CENTER"** (100 energy)
- **"SWAP SIDES NOW"** (post-intermission)
- **"VOLTAIC IMAGES - CC AND KILL"** (ðŸ”´ heroic)
- **"SOAK SCRAPBOMB - GROUP UP"**
- **"STATIC BAR HIGH - MINIMIZE MOVEMENT"**

## Group Assignments

```
Left Side (Torq)          Right Side (Flarendo)
- Tank 1                  - Tank 2
- Healer 1-2             - Healer 3-4
- DPS Group 1            - DPS Group 2
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Bosses too close together (immunity)
2. Uneven boss health (can't kill simultaneously)
3. Missing Scrapbomb soaks
4. Excessive movement on Torq side
5. Not swapping sides after Colossal Clash
