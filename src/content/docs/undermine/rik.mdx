# Rik Reverb - Heroic Raid Leader Guide

## Boss Overview

**Fight Style:** Single boss with Sonic Amplifier management  
**Phases:** Main phase with intermissions (avoid 3rd = enrage)  
**Bloodlust:** On pull  
**Core Mechanic:** Sonic Amplifiers drain rotation

## Complete Ability List

### Sonic Blast (Tank Mechanic)

- **Effect:** Frontal cone + Tinnitus debuff (100% damage increase, stacking)
- **Tank Swap:** After 5 stacks of Tinnitus
- **Positioning:** Face away from raid

### Amplification (Core Mechanic)

- **Spawns:** 2 Sonic Amplifiers every 30-40 seconds
- **Raid Damage:** 477,950 Sonic damage every 2s per amplifier (+25% per additional)
- **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Lingering Voltage:** 100% increased drain damage for 45s (prevents same person draining repeatedly)

### ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Pyrotechnics (Explosive Barrels)

- **Timer:** 15 seconds to kill before massive explosion
- **Buff:** Attacking barrels gives Excitement (+10% speed, +2% haste, stacks 3x)
- **Priority:** Immediate when spawned
- **Assignment:** All ranged DPS

## Intermission - Hype Hustle

- **Trigger:** Boss reaches 100 energy
- **Blaring Drop:** 4.2M damage expanding rings (LETHAL)
- **Survival:** Use amplifier knockback to avoid rings
- **Duration:** ~20 seconds
- **ðŸ”´ Third intermission = ENRAGE**

## Role Assignments

### Tank Strategy

- **Primary Tank:** Face boss away, track Tinnitus stacks
- **Off Tank:** Can solo drain amplifiers while not tanking
- **Swap:** At 5 Tinnitus stacks

### Amplifier Draining System

- **2-person rotation** per amplifier required on Heroic
- **Tanks:** Can solo amplifiers while off-tanking
- **Coordination:** Prevent Lingering Voltage overlap
- **Assignment Example:**
  - North Amplifier: Melee 1 â†’ Melee 2 â†’ Tank (repeat)
  - South Amplifier: Ranged 1 â†’ Ranged 2 â†’ Healer (repeat)

### DPS Priorities

1. **ðŸ”´ HEROIC: Pyrotechnics** (Explosive Barrels) - Immediate
2. Boss damage (avoid 3rd intermission)
3. Amplifier draining rotation

### Healer Considerations

- **Constant raid damage** from active amplifiers
- **Spike damage** during barrel explosions
- **Cooldowns:** Save for high amplifier counts

## Critical Raid Leader Callouts

- **"BARRELS UP - All ranged swap to barrels NOW"**
- **"[Name] drain north amplifier, [Name] drain south"**
- **"Intermission starting - move to amplifiers"**
- **"Ring expanding - use knockback NOW"**
- **"Tinnitus at 5 - TANK SWAP"**

## Positioning

```
    [Boss]
      â†‘
   [Tanks]
      |
  [Melee]
      |
 [Ranged]
     / \
[Amp 1] [Amp 2]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not killing Pyrotechnics barrels fast enough
2. Same person draining amplifiers (Lingering Voltage)
3. Missing intermission knockback timing
4. Allowing 3rd intermission (enrage)
5. Tank not facing boss away during Sonic Blast
